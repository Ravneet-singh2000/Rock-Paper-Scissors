# Rock Paper Scissors 🪨📄✂️

Hey there! 👋

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game I made using Python. It's a little project I built as part of my **100 Days of Python** challenge — and this is **Day 4**!

The game runs in the terminal and uses some fun ASCII art to show what you and the computer picked. It was a great way to practice lists, conditionals, and working with user input.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python file.
2. You'll be asked to choose:
   - `0` for Rock  
   - `1` for Paper  
   - `2` for Scissors
3. The computer makes its move randomly.
4. The game tells you who won (with a little bit of flair 😄).

## Why I'm Doing This

I’ve challenged myself to code every day and build something small — even if it's basic. This project helped me understand how to work with user input, the `random` module, and gave me an excuse to add some goofy ASCII art too.

More to come as I keep going with the challenge! 🚀

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
